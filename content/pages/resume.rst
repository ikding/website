Work Experience
-----------------------------------------------------------

Manager, Data Science – Credit Card Fraud Defense, Capital One, McLean, VA, 12/2017-Present
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Lead data scientist for developing and deploying machine learning models for payment fraud defense of our entire credit card portfolios in US and Canada. The models scores > 700M individual payments totaling $400B from > 40M customers per year, led to fraud savings of > $50M / yr over legacy model, and > $100M / yr overall.
* Built reusable, end-to-end model development pipelines, including infrastructure provisioning on AWS-EMR, data pull and feature engineering code in PySpark and SQL, gradient boosting trees models in H2O, and model monitoring stack in Python, InfluxDB, and Grafana.
* Coordinated model deployment on AWS-based platform and conducted model validation in prod; captured bugs introduced during the feature function rewrite in Java, thus allowing on-schedule model deployment.
* Intimately involved in data scientist recruiting processes for the entire enterprise, serving as one of a handful of interviewers for majority of on-site DS interviews, and provide feedback to shape our recruiting practices.


Manager, Data Science/PM – Enterprise Customer Intelligence, Capital One, Vienna, VA, 03/2017-12/2017
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Built prototype tools to consume customer digital interaction event streams on Kafka, and explored NLP / sequence models to generate insights to power personalized customer experiences over digital channels.
* Interim product manager of in-house clickstream analytics platform that leverages Kafka and Snowplow. Coalesced efforts for monitoring and analysis, and coordinated user transition from legacy platform.


Principal Data Scientist – Analytical Solutions, Capital One Labs, Arlington, VA, 04/2015-03/2017
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Analyzed TBs of credit card transactions to identify characteristics and trends of block-level neighborhoods in selected US cities. Developed geospatial data pipelines in Python (fiona, rtree, shapely) and postgres / PostGIS, customer segmentation models in Python, and geospatial data-viz web app in R-shiny / leaflet.
* Product owner & team lead for internal platform to automate workflows for business metrics monitoring and dashboards using Python, InfluxDB, and Grafana. Mentored 50+ analysts in 30+ teams, and implemented self-service instruction to scale adoption. (More details available on my PyCon 2019 talk: `abstract <https://us.pycon.org/2019/schedule/presentation/220/>`_ and `video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcPwf4Ej12M>`_)


Senior Data Scientist – LED Characterization, Philips Lumileds, San Jose, CA, 12/2012-04/2015
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Developed statistical analysis and data visualization tool in R-shiny, reduced routine analysis time by 95%.
* Built reusable data pipelines on manufacturing line data to connect multiple processing and testing steps, and developed tree-based models to provide insight on process control capabilities and improve yield.


Senior Device Engineer, Alta Devices Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, 06/2011-10/2012
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Performed electrical and optical modeling to predict and improve thin film GaAs solar cell performance.
* Developed fabrication processes to improve solar cell efficiency, leading to `2 world records <http://www.nrel.gov/ncpv/images/efficiency_chart.jpg>`_ and `3 patents <https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lCtbDgkAAAAJ>`_.
