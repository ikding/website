Question
--------

After I email-requested a higher salary in response to a job offer, the employer wants to discuss by phone. How should I handle the conversation?

Answer
------

One of the many good salary negotiation resources that I have used is the book called `"Negotiating Your Salary: How To Make $1000 a Minute" (Chapman) <http://www.amazon.com/Negotiating-Your-Salary-Minute-Revised/dp/1580083102>`_. One take-away from the book is that you have to know your market value, your own range, and BATNA (Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement).

In terms of range, here are three numbers in mind:

1. Ideal: highest number that can pass a "laughing test" (a number that, if any higher, the person might think the counter-party is joking)
2. Satisfactory: a market-rate number that you think is fair.
3. No-go: the lowest acceptable number.

From your description it sounds like the number you were offered was between satisfactory and no-go. In that case, I'd argue that you definitely should try to negotiate, but be prepared to back your number up with your market research.

So long as you ask respectfully, they likely won't rescind the offer because you ask for more money. In that case, the worst answer is "no raise", which is the same result as if you don't negotiate at all. So what's there to lose?

P.S. if you have time, buy the book (or borrow it somewhere) and read it before having the phone call with the new employer. The book is recommended to me by the career development center at my school years ago and I have re-read that book every time I negotiate salary with a new employer. I don't earn referral fees if you buy that book - just thought that was a good resource.
