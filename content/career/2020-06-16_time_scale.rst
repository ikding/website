:summary: Just realized something cool - earlier in my career, I was studying solar cell dynamics that happens at sub-nanosecond timescale. Now I'm working to find mineral deposits generated by geological processes that happened up to 1000s MYA (million-years-ago). Time scale span of >25 orders of magnitude!


Just realized something cool - earlier in my career, I was studying solar cell dynamics that happens at sub-nanosecond timescale. Now I'm working to find mineral deposits generated by geological processes that happened up to 1000s MYA (million-years-ago). Time scale span of >25 orders of magnitude!

Coincidentally, the geometric mean of these two extremes is squarely in the timescale that we humans are used to thinking about (~hours)!

P.S. I spent way too much time reading this wikipedia article: `Orders of magnitude (time) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(time)>`_.
