Following up to the `Quora article <{filename}./2016-03-31_software_engineer_salary.rst>`_ I wrote the other day, I made a data visualization tool to help people choose where to work in US.

`Where Should You Work? <https://ikding.shinyapps.io/bls_salary/>`_

The tool is based with bureau of labor statistics (BLS) salary survey and C2ER cost-of-living index data, both from 2014. You can search for a field of work (e.g. Software Engineers, Materials Scientists, Physicists, Musicians), and inspect the resulting table and barchart. The tool will also tell you the top metro to work, based on median wage (with or without cost-of-living adjustment), total employment... etc.

Hope this is helpful for my friends!
