Many of you know that I have recently transitioned my career from from a materials scientist by training (PhD in Materials Science and Engineering, worked in silicon valley in the optoelectronic industry as a device and characterization engineer for close to 4 years), before pivoting my career to become a data scientist.

I have met many people that are interested in how I made the leap, so I decided to write a document to explain this. I made the transition first by taking a lot of courses on MOOC (Coursera), use R extensively during work, and attended a data science bootcamp (Data Incubator). I also spent some time talking about the interview experiences and the resources I used in preparing for those interviews.

The full (24-page) document is available on dropbox: `From materials scientist to data scientist <https://www.dropbox.com/s/837ynk0uzksinbo/From_Materials_Scientist_to_Data_Scientist.pdf?dl=0>`_. Given that the document is on the long side (20+ pages), I threw in a few comic strips that engineers will appreciate here and there, in order to make it a bit less dry. So even if you are not interested in my story, maybe you will be interested in the nerdy humor? Anyhow, hope that helps!

P.S. If you find the document informative, feel free to share it with others.
