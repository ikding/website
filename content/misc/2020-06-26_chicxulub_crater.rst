Reading about `Chicxulub crater <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater>`__ (aka. "dinosaur killer") on wikipedia (as one does), I was surprised that connecting the crater to `K–Pg boundary <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous–Paleogene_boundary>`__ happened much more recent than I thought. Crater was discovered in 1981; linking it to K–Pg boundary happened in 1991.

Other things that happened in 1991: Gulf war and collapse of USSR. These are not "current events" to be sure, but it still is much more recent than I thought.
