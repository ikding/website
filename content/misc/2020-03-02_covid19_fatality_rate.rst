:summary: One thing that's somewhat under-appreciated in my mind about COVID19 is that it has disproportionately higher fatality rate for older adults. And many of our political leaders are old. It's not inconceivable that the virus could claim lives of high-profile politicians.

As a thought experiment, I downloaded the birth years of current US senators and US congressman/woman into a table, and tabulate it by age brackets.

Under the scenario that the virus infected all members of US congress (both senate and house), and the fatality rate matches the rate from Chinese CDC, the expected fatality would include 4 sitting senators and 14 sitting congressmen/women. That's really scary.
