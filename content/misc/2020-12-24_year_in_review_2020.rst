Hello our friends and families,

Can't believe that it is now the end of 2020! A lot has happened this year around the globe... so we're all glad that this year is now almost behind us! Pandemic aside, a lot has happened in our family in this memorable year. (The photo below was taken during our visit to Disney World this January. It felt like ages ago now!)

After living in Maryland (DC suburbs) since 2015, our family relocated back to San Francisco Bay Area in August. Moving across the country during a pandemic is a scary thing, but we’re glad that we were able to complete the move while keeping everyone in the family healthy and safe in the process.

Ethan and Luke are now in 5th and 2nd grade, respectively. They got a few weeks of winter soccer in before the pandemic forced much of the soccer year to close down, but Ethan and Luke were glad that they got to play a sand soccer tournament with their respective teams in July. They have also enjoyed their new soccer club (Liverpool international academy) in the Bay Area even though the soccer practice is strictly no-contact right now.

As for school, Ethan and Luke both were both able to quickly adjust to online learning. Although definitely not ideal, we see how resilient they are to still manage to do their best and be engaged despite the circumstances!

As for the parents, we were very fortunate that both of us started new, fulfilling jobs this year, and we can do our jobs effectively from the comfort of our own home.

Marian finished her PhD degree from Johns Hopkins after 5 years, and started her new job at UCSF as a research staff member in August. She is excited to be working on several projects related to addressing gaps in research participation, in particular, aging-related research, among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders communities.

I-Kang left his job at Capital One after close to 5 years, and started a new job at KoBold Metals, a startup working on mineral exploration of battery materials (such as Cobalt) using data science. He is excited to be back to contributing on the solution of climate change again after a 5-year hiatus.

Last but certainly not the least, we have two new members in the Ding family! No, we did not have twins, if that’s what you’re thinking.  We adopted two sweet kittens, Teba and Mipha in early December through a matching program. We did not know in advance which two kittens will be matched with us, so it was like a blind date, but it was love at first sight. It took them no time to make our home their home, and we are so lucky and grateful to have them.

Hopefully by this time next year, COVID-19 will be in our rear view mirror.  Our warmest wishes to you all for a healthy, happy and prosperous new year.
