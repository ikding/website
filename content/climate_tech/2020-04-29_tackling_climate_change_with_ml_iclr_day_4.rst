Notes from day 4 (Climate Science and Adaptation Day) of ICLR Workshop - `Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning <https://www.climatechange.ai/ICLR2020_workshop#schedule>`__ on 2020-04-29. (I was only able to attend Lucas Joppa's talk in this session)

The virtual conference spans five days. If you're interested, here are the notes I took for other days.

* `Day 1 (Main Workshop) <{filename}../climate_tech/2020-04-26_tackling_climate_change_with_ml_iclr_day_1.rst>`_
* `Day 2 (Energy Day) <{filename}../climate_tech/2020-04-27_tackling_climate_change_with_ml_iclr_day_2.rst>`_
* `Day 3 (Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU) Day) <{filename}../climate_tech/2020-04-28_tackling_climate_change_with_ml_iclr_day_3.rst>`_
* `Day 5 (Cross-cutting Methods Day) <{filename}../climate_tech/2020-04-30_tackling_climate_change_with_ml_iclr_day_5.rst>`_


Adaptability Session
--------------------

Learn more about the how machine learning can help in climate adaptation and how technology leaders, such as Google and Microsoft, are leveraging their AI expertise in building a climate resilient future.

Lucas Joppa, Chief Environmental Officer, Microsoft

* He made a passionate plea - we spent so much time organizing the spatio-temporal information of the human world (where can I find the closest Starbucks?), and it's embarrassing how little we know about the planet! Trees, elevations, â€¦ etc.
* There are problems that just through better classification, we can drastically improve our understanding. E.g. better elevation models, better flood forecasting
