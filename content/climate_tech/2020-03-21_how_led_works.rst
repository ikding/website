In the midst of the global pandemic, we all need some distractions. So... I present you, the operating principle of engineering marvel that is light emitting diode (LED), as told through cute animal gifs!

First, some "light" science. "White light" is produced by mixing right amount of R/G/B. In LEDs, we have a semiconductor film that produces blue light, with some phosphor sprinkled on top that absorb blue light and emit green/yellow light. Yes, just like cat on toast.

The semiconductor film that can emit blue light efficiently was the subject of Noble Prize in Physics in 2014. Modern LEDs have "Multi-Quantum Wells" structure that has tens of layers, each only 2-20 nm thick, grown in 700+ degree C ovens. A very elaborate slalom, indeed.

Because of the large refractive index of the semiconductor film, the light that was generated inside the film can be easily trapped and never get out. Much engineering is done to make sure we can free the photons from film, much like freeing cat from a jar.

But wait! for semiconductor film to generate light, we also need to put down electrical contacts so we can pass current into the film. Again, much engineering is done to make this happen. (No pikachu is actually harmed in making LEDs, I believe.)

Now you have a semiconductor film that emits blue light. Time to add your special phosphors on our film so that it converts just the right amounts of blue light into green and red. How do you do it? Answer: very carefully...

The process of figuring out how much phosphor to add is like hyperspace (aka. (u′, v′) colorspace) curling. You want to land your light spectrum in the "target" that is perceived as "white". If you didn't add the right phosphor in the right mix, it will not look "white".

Now you know all the steps of how white LEDs are made, and also looked at cute animal gifs! The million dollar question is, how to make billions of LEDs, for pennies per unit, and make sure LEDs last 10+ years? That is left as an exercise for the reader :)
