Notes from day 2 (Energy Day) of ICLR Workshop - `Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning <https://www.climatechange.ai/ICLR2020_workshop#schedule>`__ on 2020-04-27.

The virtual conference spans five days. If you're interested, here are the notes I took for other days.

* `Day 1 (Main Workshop) <{filename}../climate_tech/2020-04-26_tackling_climate_change_with_ml_iclr_day_1.rst>`_
* `Day 3 (Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU) Day) <{filename}../climate_tech/2020-04-28_tackling_climate_change_with_ml_iclr_day_3.rst>`_
* `Day 4 (Climate Science and Adaptation Day) <{filename}../climate_tech/2020-04-29_tackling_climate_change_with_ml_iclr_day_4.rst>`_
* `Day 5 (Cross-cutting Methods Day) <{filename}../climate_tech/2020-04-30_tackling_climate_change_with_ml_iclr_day_5.rst>`_


Opportunities and Challenges for Machine Learning in the African Electricity Sector

Big data for electricity consumption prediction. Sophisticated energy planning tools exist but rely on poor quality demand data.

* Big data from utilities:

  * use geolocated historical billing data and satellite imagery from 100ks of customers
  * Deep learning to make large scale prediction at fine spatial resolution

* Rich data from mini-grids

  * Uses detailed survey and smart meter data from the off-grid sector from thousands of customers
  * ML methods to make better predictions for system design and financial planning

* Using consumption data to improve system planning and operation

  * Estimating subsidies for grid extension
  * Small commercial consumption patterns

* Co-planning of electricity and agricultural infrastructure

  * Goal: create geospatial data products to facilitate cross-sectorial planning of infrastructure planning

* Mapping power quality and reliability with night lights imagery (work done for India)


Opportunities

* Fill data gaps using public available data
* Measure infra (location, condition, reliability)
* Improve system planning (design and efficiency with better demand data)
* Identify opp for productive use
* Facilitating access to credit for unbanked

Challenges:

* Data availability, data quality, data access
* Capacity, skills and infra at data gathering org
* Data standardization
* Privacy and data security

* Artificial intelligence in climate change solutions:

  * Energy storage: PowerFlex, Energy Vault, EnZinc
  * Green generation / grid management: SolarCity, Solar.com, Ocergy, predictive for solar and wind, Station A, Open EE
  * Mobility / logistics: Tesla, autonomous, ride share, mapping / directions, flying cars, Flux EV
  * Built environment: SkyCool systems, Stasis Energy group, Opower, Nativus power, ZYD energy, correlate, 75F

* Getting to "go":

  * Market: size, cycle, velocity, pain, etc
  * Identify "compelling value hypothesis": features, audience, business model, USPs: "will the dog eat the food"
  * Test: build, measure, learn from potential customers, iterate
  * Intense and active patience: take your time, PMF is the priority - not being first. Iterate quickly based on feedback toward MVP, retest, stay alive
  * Are you there? Growing exponentially without marketing, strong word-of-mouth from delighted customers, voting with dollars
  * Reasons startups fail: no market fit, ran out of cash, team
