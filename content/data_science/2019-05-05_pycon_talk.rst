I and two Capital One colleagues (Ariel M'ndange-Pfupfu and Marina Sergeeva) gave a talk at PyCon 2019 titled `Lessons learned from building a community of Python users among thousands of analysts <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcPwf4Ej12M>`_.

This talk highlighted our multi-pronged approaches to overcome organizational inertia to build a community of Python users, provide Python and OSS training, and scaling Python adoption in the business analyst and data analyst workforces in a Fortune 500 company.

Thanks to Python community at Capital One for making this talk possible, and we had a blast at PyCon 2019!

Addendum (2020-01-08): Our talk has been converted into a blog post, `Lessons learned from building a community of Python users among Capital One's analysts <{filename}./2020-01-08_building_python_community_among_analysts.rst>`_.
