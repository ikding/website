Question
--------

What do data scientists think of the galvanizeU data scientist program?

Answer
------

I have not attended the galvanizeU data scientist program myself, but I have interviewed candidates from the 12-week galvanize data science immersive program and I felt the curriculum is reasonably solid.

Looking at the full-year curriculum of galvanizeU, I think the courses there has longer ramp-time than the 12-week immersive program, and may be geared toward people with less existing background, but the program appears to give a good overview of the techniques used in the data scientist's day-to-day work. However, if the program is indeed full-time for one-year, I do wonder if the program can be compressed further from its current format (6 credits every 8 weeks).

What really caught my eye is internship and capstone part. If done correctly, this could be a good differentiator when the graduates apply for jobs. Data Science is part science, part craft; knowing the business context and being able to distinguish whether a business problem has a data science based solution is often as important as knowing all the supervised and unsupervised algorithms under the sun. If the candidate can get a good internship and capstone experience that enables them to apply their skill set in a real-world case, this could be an excellent distinguisher.

Of course, the points above depends a lot on how well their program can execute on the internship and capstone. I'd love to see someone who actually went through the program to write a review.
