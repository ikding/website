:summary: Documenting my environment setup, including shell, text editor, and more.


I have been working as a data scientist for almost 8 years now, and have been working from home majority of the time for the past 5 years. I also started a new job recently and had to set up my new work laptop, so I am using this post to document the environments I use, for future reference:

Shell
-----

I use ``zsh`` shell with `Powerlevel10k <https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k>`_ theme.

I am also storing my dotfiles in a repo. The dotfiles in my home directory are symlinked to my local repo, so I can keep my dotfiles version controlled. The repo available here: `ikding/dotfiles <https://github.com/ikding/dotfiles>`_.


Text editor
-----------

I have been using `Visual Studio code <https://code.visualstudio.com>`_ as my main text editor for a few years now, and has enjoyed the experience a lot. Below are the vscode extensions that I use on a regular basis. (My primary programming language is Python).
