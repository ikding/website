I visited JHU to attend a talk on R and deep learning (tensorflow), and was incredibly lucky to meet JHU professors Jeff Leek and Brian Caffo in person!

I took a series of data science in R courses taught by these two professors (along with Prof. Roger Peng) back in 2013/14, so in a way I was taking JHU courses way before Marian did :)

(The reason I was holding my laptop in the picture is that I want to show off my coursera certificate from the first JHU data science specialization cohort from Dec 2014. Too bad the certificate didn't show up well...)
