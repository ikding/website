Came across the article on Nature, `The reality behind solar power's next star material <https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01985-y>`_.

Perovskites solar cells has came a long way since my PhD research. I remember my excitement when my solid state dye-sensitized solar cells (predecessor to perovskites solar cells) cracked 4% efficiency... and now the single junction world record for perovskites is at 24.2%!

Also - how crazy is it that three of the perovskites startups in this article are co-founded by people I know?
